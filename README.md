# Andrea Toreki Toreki Portfolio Web Overview

This project represents my journey as a software engineer to master the intersection of design and development. I set out to create a portfolio that would not only showcase my technical skills but also demonstrate my ability to craft immersive, visually stunning user experiences.

This is a fully responsive, celestial-themed developer portfolio featuring smooth scroll-linked animations, dynamic light/dark mode theming, and a futuristic UI built entirely from scratch. The portfolio includes interactive 3D elements, particle effects, and seamless transitions that create an engaging browsing experience while maintaining optimal performance.

I created this software to push the boundaries of what's possible with modern web technologies, combining React's component architecture with advanced animation libraries and creative visual effects. This project serves as both a showcase of my capabilities and a testament to my commitment to creating memorable digital experiences that blend technical precision with artistic vision.

## Development Environment

This project was built using a modern, cutting-edge development stack designed for performance, maintainability, and developer experience:

**Frontend Framework & Language:**

- React 19 with TypeScript for type-safe, component-based architecture
- Vite as the build tool for lightning-fast development and optimized production builds

**Styling & Animation:**

- Styled Components for component-scoped CSS and dynamic theming
- Framer Motion for smooth, performant animations and micro-interactions
- Custom keyframe animations for celestial effects

**3D Graphics & Effects:**

- Three.js with React Three Fiber for 3D geometric shapes and interactive elements
- React Three Drei for enhanced 3D utilities and controls
- Custom canvas-based particle systems for starry backgrounds

**Development Tools:**

- ESLint and TypeScript for code quality and type safety
- React Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
- Custom hooks for theme management and scroll position tracking

**Deployment:**

- Vercel for seamless CI/CD and global edge deployment
- Git for version control and collaborative development
